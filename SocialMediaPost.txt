I have chosen r/python as the main bulk of original content in this project
was written in python, and as it seems to be more friendly towards amateur
projects than other applicable subreddits.
Note: it seems to be convention on this subreddit for users posting their own
work to begin with "I made a" followed by a brief description - I will be following
this format, except that I will also be using a slightly more detailed text description that
I will post in the comments.

Title: I made an application that stores logs of user interaction and replays them using Selenium
Image: A screenshot of a section of the replicator.py script, found in this folder
Description: This project uses a modified version of this (https://github.com/greenstick/interactor)
script to send session log objects to a python script which saves them as a json log file. A seperate
python script can then replay those logs using python selenium.
