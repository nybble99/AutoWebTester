                    "Testing is a crucial part of web app development and can take around (and sometimes over) 30% of developer time. Modern commercial web applications often 
                    include logging to track user behaviour on a web site to better optimise web application development. By adapting these logs so that they can be ‘replayed’ 
                    automated tests can be created by manually testing a web application once and then using the logs to automatically verify the test each time 
                    (after some minor modification to check that some output states are correct) 
                    <br> 
                    The purpose of this project is to adapt a minimal user logging system such as 
                    <a href = "https://github.com/greenstick/interactor">https://github.com/greenstick/interactor</a> (Links to an external site.)) 
                    to create selenium scripts that can repeat the web operations that the user performed so that end to end tests of web applications can be trivially 
                    created just by manually using the site. The system can assume that controls on web pages have unique ids (so that minor changes to web pages don’t break 
                    the selenium scripts)."

                The intent of this project is to create an application that, when implemented on a webserver, can record the interactions a user has with a webpage, 
                store those interactions as log files, and then "replay" the interactions in those files as closely as possible, either when manually triggered or as part of 
                scheduled testing.

            <p class="contentText">
                Once completed, this project could greatly decrease the effort and time consumption required in typical web testing - a developer can simply record 
                one session of testing and replay it when desired, or even (consensually) record user logs to be replayed automatically.

            <p class="contentText">
                This project uses Javascript for the interaction-logging script, and Python for the server-side log receiver program and replayer program.

            <h2 class="contentHeading2">How does this project work?<hr></h2>
            <p class="contentText">The application works as follows:<br>
                <ul class="contentText">
                    <li>The user implements the interaction logging script into their webpage, specifying which elements they want to track.</li>
                    <li>Any logs collected from this page will be sent to a server endpoint specified by the user (usually just using the loopback address).</li>
                    <li>A simple log receiver script will save any logs received to a specified directory.</li>
                    <li>The replayer program can then replay these logs when opened.</li>

                <h1 class="contentHeading1">initial intro and refreshers</h1>
                    <p class="contentText">
                        The first step I took in beginning this project was to refresh myself on both Python and JavaScript using the
                        courses on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>. I had used both Python and JavaScript before, but
                        had never developed a full project with them, so it seemed like a good idea to catch myself up beforehand. The tutorials
                        provided by w3schools were extremely helpful for this.

                <h1 class="contentHeading1">initial interactor dissection</h1>
                    <p class="contentText">
                        The script linked in the project description, <a href="https://github.com/greenstick/interactor">interactor.js</a> (which I'm going
                        to refer to as interactor to be concise) was the next thing I decided to have a look at. It does what it says on the tin - it collects
                        various data on the interactions a user has with the tracked webpage, and sends a log of that data to a server when the page is closed.
                        It also offers a degree of customisation over which elements, and which interactions with those elements, are supposed to be tracked.
                        This script was a very important part of development, and I ended up using a modified version of it in the final project, but at this
                        point I didn't fully understand it. I assumed the script could easily save a file on the same server the webpage was hosted on, casually
                        overlooking the part of the documentation noting that the logs would be sent to "a user defined server endpoint." Truly Icarian levels of
                        hubris going on here.

                    <p class="contentText">
                        Before realising that the data had to be sent to a server, I tried various methods to attempt to get my hands on interactor's logs.
                        After fiddling with the file paths inside interactor to no avail, I tried using console.log(), document.write() and alert(), but, of
                        course, none of these worked because interactor outputs its logs on the beforeunload event, just as the page is closing.
                        After doing some research, I tried using the fs (File system) module in Node.js to write the log to a file, but Node.js turned out to
                        be far to complicated for me to use. 
                        As I had somehow not managed to figure out I needed a server, I tried to rig together a file download by converting the log to a
                        BLOB and having the user trigger the download manually on the page using a button. What I intended to accomplish with this escapes me.
                        Regardless, this method worked somewhat, giving me a log of the data interactor saves when the user opens the page - various pieces of
                        metadata sent with the request.

                    <p class="contentText">
                        Eventually, I found out that I would have to set up a local web server to actually make any progress, and decided to use XAMMP, a simple web server
                        application, for this purpose. XAMMP was surprisingly easy to setup - just a matter of choosing a minimal installation and popping a webpage in one of 
                        its folders. However, whereas this was useful for hosting the page that would host interactor, it wouldn't work for processing and saving the log file. 
                        It was still just a web page, after all (This doesn't mean I didn't try, however.) For that, I would need to use Flask.

                <h1 class="contentHeading1">Initial Flask stuff</h1>
                    <p class="contentText">
                        Flask is a very lightweight web application framework built in Python, and was a great fit for my project.
                        Installation was very simple using PIP, python's package installer. Setting up a basic server was a bit harder,
                        but still not too bad - I managed to get a basic server up and running quite quickly using a test script from the
                        <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">flask documentation</a>. The application was logging any times
                        that I requested the page I was hosting on XAMMP, but wasn't acknowledging any of the POST requests sent by interactor from
                        the same page. Digging around the developer console, the POST request was returning a 404 error, so evidently interactor wasn't 
                        sending to the right address. After some tweaking I fixed this, but got a different error instead, saying something about
                        CORS and the Same Origin Policy. I looked both of these up, finding that CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is a standard
                        to control which addresses are allowed to use resources from differnet addresses, and the Same Origin Policy was part of that,
                        denying my request to the flask application since it was coming from a different origin. I thought this was strange, considering that
                        both the webpage and the application were both running off of my machine, but I figured out that it was because they were both 
                        using different ports - the flask server was using 5000 and the POST requester site was, naturally, using 80.
                        

                        <!-- -flask setup

                <h1 class="contentHeading1">flask cors stuff</h1>
                    <p class="contentText">
                        Well, now what? I knew what the problem was but had no way to fix it. I tried messing around with various options in both the webpage
                        and the flask application, but nothing was helping. However, a kind soul in a stackoverflow thread eventually pointed me to flask-cors.
                        Flask-cors is an extension for flask which takes care of, you guessed it, Cross Origin Resource Requests. Installation was again simple
                        using PIP, and implementing it within the flask application was as simple as importing the library and calling a method. After fixing a
                        a typo in the flask script, the POST request was finally getting a 200 response - everything was working as intended.

                    <p class="contentText">
                        After getting the post request working, it was a relatively easy matter to get the interactor log saved to a file. I just imported the request
                        class from flask, which contains all the information sent with the POST request, including the logs themselves. With that, I only needed to open
                        a file stream and write the log to a JSON file.

                        The next step was to figure how to implement interactor into any webpage - up to this point I had only been using test pages supplied in the interactor 
                        documentation. This was pretty easy to figure out - it was just a matter of calling interactor in the body of the webpage and changing the class of any
                        elements that should be tracked to "interaction". Various input parameters can be specified in a script also placed in the body, but so far I have only
                        needed the default ones.
